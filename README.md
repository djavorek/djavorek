# Hello there 👋
## 🎄 Have a wonderful Christmas and Happy New Year ✨

## Take a look at my repositories, and remember:
- This is my free-time Github, everything you see is just for fun. 🤷‍♂️
- There are a lot of repos in Work in Progress status, feel free to open a PR or issue. What I can give in exchange: 
  - Kind words. 🤗
  - A beer or two, if you are around. 🍺
